Guide to key projects referenced in resume.

## C++ : [Deck Of Cards Minigames](https://github.com/jtsmith7248/Deck-Of-Cards-Game_ITCS-2550-Final)
  This project connects to the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/), send in the user's request for a given number of cards. They will get dealt back that many cards out of a deck of 52 or 54, depnding on if the game requires jokers. Then, the user will play one of two mini games using these randomly dealt cards utilizing searching and sorting algorithms while maintaining basic principles of OOP. 


## Web Design : [Coaster Cracked! Website](https://jtsmith7248.github.io/CoasterCrackedWebsite/) | [Repository](https://github.com/jtsmith7248/CoasterCrackedWebsite/)
  A few years ago, I created a website called "Coaster Cracked," a basic online forum for coaster enthusiasts. This project helped me solidify my understanding of fundamental web development skills, including structuring web pages with HTML, styling them with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Database Design : [Record Shop Simulation](https://github.com/jtsmith7248/RecordShop)
  This project from 2021 taught important lessons regarding both database management and in leading a team towards a shared goal, especially through challenging circumstances created by conflicting schedules during the global pandemic. Other key insights from this project included understanding how to model relationships between entities (e.g., customers placing orders, products provided by vendors) in addition to practicing SQL syntax for creating tables, inserting data, and defining constraints to build a robust database.

## Construct 3 : [Monster Mayhem Platformer](https://jtsmith7248.github.io/MonsterMayhem_Construct3/) | [Repository](https://github.com/jtsmith7248/MonsterMayhem_Construct3)
  Creating my first multilevel platformer in Construct 3 was an incredibly enriching experience. With over 100 events and 9 event sheets dedicated to managing game logic and layout, I gained a deep understanding of event-based programming and complex game mechanics. I learned how to design and organize said logic to handle multiple levels, player interactions, and dynamic environments efficiently. Overall, this project significantly enhanced my proficiency in game development and problem-solving. Hopefully not too bad for a first game! The second level is much more cohesive than the first. 


## Unity : Customized FlappyBird for Desktop
